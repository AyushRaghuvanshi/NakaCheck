# NakaCheck

## Don't let suspicious vehicles slip through the cracks - use our app to stay vigilant

### The problem NakaCheck solves

There is a database of stolen vehicle in the vahan portal maintained by the ministry of Road Transport and highways. We need to create a mobile app integrating with the vaahan portal through API so that a constable executing Naka at the road can check the details of the suspicious vehicle in his mobile at real time.

### Challenges we ran into

Using computer vision to extract vehicle number from the license plate.
Optimizing the code to make it feasible in real time.
